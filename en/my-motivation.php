					<h1>What <span class="bold">motivates</span> me?</h1>
					<div class="chart-legend" id="love-challenge">
						<h2><span class="bold">1. I love it</span></h2>
						<p>I’m happy to wake up every day and know I’m going to do something I truly enjoy. I can also do it freelance, which allows me to have time for hobbies.<br /><br />
						<strong><span class="bold">‘Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.’</span></strong> - Confucius</p>
						<h2 class="challenging"><span class="bold">4. It's challenging</span></h2>
						<p>It’s certainly not a routine job, switching from team to solo work, from technical work to project management... It allows me to meet new people, have new experiences and grow along with my projects.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="chart-legend" id="good-evolving">
						<h2><span class="bold">2. I'm good at it</span></h2>
						<p>I wouldn’t say I’m an expert, but I do everything I can to the highest standard possible. I believe my biggest strength is my drive to learn as much as I can and never settle for average.</p>
						<br />
						<div class="image"><div id="my-skills"><a href="web-and-design-skills.php"><img src="images/link-myskills.png" alt="Check out my skills" /></a></div></div>						
						<h2 class="evolving"><span class="bold">3. It's constantly evolving</span></h2>
						<p>It’s incredible how much the industry has evolved and continues to in such a short lapse of time. Dramatic developments occur at all times, shaping the way the web functions. Better not blink or you'll miss the show!</p>
